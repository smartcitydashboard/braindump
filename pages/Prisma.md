- Prisma is a **next-generation ORM** that consists of these tools:
	- [**Prisma Client**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client): Auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js & TypeScript
	- [**Prisma Migrate**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate): Declarative data modeling & migration system
	- [**Prisma Studio**](https://github.com/prisma/studio): GUI to view and edit data in your database
- Documentation: https://www.prisma.io/docs
- Why Prisma?
	- **Thinking in objects** instead of mapping relational data
	- **Queries not classes** to avoid complex model objects
	- **Single source of truth** for database and application models
	- **Healthy constraints** that prevent common pitfalls and anti-patterns
	- **An abstraction that makes the right thing easy** ("pit of success")
	- **Type-safe database queries** that can be validated at compile time
	- **Less boilerplate** so developers can focus on the important parts of their app
	- **Auto-completion in code editors** instead of needing to look up documentation
- Prisma is one of most capable ORMs and works well with the other tech in the stack. This makes it a good fit to enhance the development process
