- #Feature, requires the [[Map package]]
- With this package, citizens can report deficiencies by
	- marking the location of a deficiency on the map
	- describing the issue (e.g. by providing a description, choosing a category, etc.)
- Once deficiencies are reported, admins can evaluate the validity of the reported problems and decide if they want to display them on the map or if they want to remove them
- This results in a map which can give citizens and the municipality an overview over potential deficiencies in the city. Citizens thus have the opportunity to actively participate in the improvement of the city and the administration has the possibility to update citizens on ongoing fixes to problems
